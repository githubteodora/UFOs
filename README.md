# UFO Sightings

## Overview of Project:

This is a project that uses JavaScipt (D3), HTML and a little CSS. The final output of the project is a webpage that allows freely exploring a table with information about UFO sightings in the USA. The purpose of the project is to enable users to explore data about UFO signings in a friendly manner.

## Results:

The output of the project is a simple website that has 4 components: title, paragraph, table, filters.

The filtering component allows fultering by none, one, or multiple criteria. The filter fields contain example data, so that the user becomes aware of the capitalization and date format of the data in the table.

The filters will refresh the table as soon as the user fills one or multiple filter fields and clicks anywhere on the screen.

## Summary:

The webpage serves as a UFO sightings data exploration tool that is simple and easy to use. A drawback of the suggested design is that no data aggregation is available and it is difficult to easily understand for example which US city/state has accumulated the most UFO sightings. 

## Recommendations for Further Development:

 - A map can be embedded, so that uses can visually navigate it, rather than try to guess a city name with UFO sightings;
 - Gpahs and charts can be developed, so that the informaiton can be presented in a digestible format amd insights can be uncovered;

## Tools and Languages:
 - VS Code
 - JavaScript (D3)
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Bootstrap
